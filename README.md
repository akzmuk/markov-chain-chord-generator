 This is a generative music tool that creates endless chord progressions using Markov chains.
 The circle visualization shows the current chord (highlighted) and its position in the circle of fifths.
 Major chords are shown in the outer ring, with their relative minors in the inner ring.

Use the controls on the left to adjust the sound and tempo, and experiment with effects like reverb, delay, and filters.
Toggle arpeggio mode to hear the chords played as sequential notes rather than simultaneously.
